## Project Description
This is an application based on CRUD and other functionalities such as updating item details through form submission resetting form data, and so on. The project includes the use of HTML, JavaScript, and NodeJS. The data generated through the process are being kept in JSON document managed by NodeJS. The system imitates a grocery management system.
## Executive Summary
Inventory management systems allow to virtually monitor items kept in some warehouse maintained by responsible individuals physically. In retailing business, specifically for organizations operating within broad area (such as Amazon), such systems are essential to manage stock items for efficient costing and reducing wastage. The individuals at POS checkpoint updates the inventory (decreasing number or items in stock) after generating invoices. 
In order to address this scenario, this project deals with the development of an Inventory Management System(IMS) for the retail organizationGreenLeafGrocers, a supermarket that deals in fresh produce and other products with minimal environmental impacts. The system aims at improving inefficiencies related to inventory tracking, stock control and order handling by managing them using a system with create, retrieve, update, and delete capacity. Developed using the API structure, the IMS facilitates well-integrated frontend->backend functionalities and real-time data update and adjustment for the different devices. Some of the fields include data validations, error checking mechanism, and easily understandable Graphical User Interface (GUI). Through inventory operations the system improves decision making and operation and provides funding for further development and changes in the future.
## Introduction
The project deals with the Inventory Management System for GreenLeaf Grocers, a supermarket of a limited size providing fresh vegetables and sustainable products. Some of the problems solved involve organization of inventory, stock, and order management as the system is a digital form of solving them. Its objectives include providing timely stock information, controlling the excess of stocks and controlling excessive stock. The solution will be customized to GreenLeaf's requirements, allowing staff to control stocks through CRUD operations besides producing important reports for proper decision making. The present sample illustrates the main functionalities of the application by implementing an API-based approach to frontend/backend integration, with focus on simplicity and ease of use.
## Requirements Specification
The Requirements Specification document or Specification for the reference system lists down the fundamental capabilities and characteristics of the proposed system. The system outlines its purpose and in this case; managing and tracking inventory is one of the capabilities with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) accessibility on items. The system will allow the addition of the inventory items, modifications of the inventory and removal of items in the inventory. The attributes in each item will include; ID, name, category, price, quantity and expiry date. The system will scrub the input so as to maintain good data quality of the items that need to enter in the system. Data will be stored in a file in JSON format which will allow its survival from session to session. It will also consist of a table for displaying inventory with links for users to engage with the displayed items. On the same note, the design of the system should be flexible, and should react appropriately based on the device in use and this includes laptop, tabs, mobile screens among others. These include items such as processing speed and the evaluation of which data can load most efficiently, among other fundamental items, user safety can be validated and errors can be handled.
The programming environment or codespace, github.dev, has been configured by installing the “node” into the docker container before building the project with this dependency. On the other hand, a rebuilding has been conducted after the installation of “Express” by executing the “npm i express” in the terminal. With these dependencies, Express is employed to channel the data from the input form field to the JSON document (inventory.json) where inventory records are kept. NodeJS plays a crucial role in data handling as it enables Express to function as an API endpoint. The dataflow caused by the CRUD operation are maintained this way to show the working of the developed inventory management system.

## Conclusion
This paper analyzed how the development of the IMS for GreenLeaf Grocers has been able to offer a solution to the problems faced by the organization in managing its inventory. Here the system offered technology support to facilitate the stocks storage alongside helping in tracking of stock, and also in the management of orders. When implemented it showed how CRUD operations can be used, clearly illustrating how entities could be created, read, updated and deleted to allow clients to manage their inventory. This IMS boasts features such as real time update of data, validation of data and of course, the user friendly interface enhanced the efficiency of its operation while at the same time cutting off on errors. In the process of the frontend-backend integration, we obtained a reliable and zejména API-based architecture that can be easily extended in the future. Since the system was responsive, you were able to meet the needs of different devices making it easier to use and access.
